# Algorithmic Trading Strategy
This Algorithmic Trading strategy is broken down into two portions. 
The goal of this Technical Indicator super class in Part 1 is to return a dataframe which consists of the price data of a stock as well as 3 technical indicators associated with it. Part 2 uses OOP to create a Backtesting subclass and displays the chosen strategy's performance.
